We found out that there are two types of people who can potentially become our main customers.

 First, people suffering from chronic disease always need to accurately track their health conditions. Moreover, for peoples’ age above 65 generally have a higher chance to get chronic disease and side effects such as cerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction and so on. In other words, these people generally are in a more dangerous health condition than other ages. Our product definitely can help them to prevent and avoid those health risks. 

 Second, parents have children under age 5 or children have congenital disease. In the first case, for parents who are busy with their work and don’t have too much time to look after their kids, our product will be a good choice for them to track kids’ location and health condition, in case any emergency happens. In the second case, kids who have congenital disease always need special care. But even with special care, kids under age are hard to describe their feelings and symptoms, inaccurate description could lead to inaccurate treatment
